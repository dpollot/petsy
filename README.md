PETSY
=====

A python (3) wrapper around the [etsy api](https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation).

This project began as a way for me to refresh myself with python (having not used it since college - a long time ago). is in the early stages of development and therefore incomplete, however it should provide a good starting place for anyone looking to consume the API.

### Installation
PIP3 install petsy (eventually)

### Usage
Examples coming soon!
